\section*{Motivation}
This thesis is about a deeper look on MD5 and SHA1.
We take a closer look at the Master thesis of M. Stevens: a fast collisions finding algorithm [1].
The goal is to work out a more clear and understandable code, which is not necessarily faster, to reevaluate the code on modern systems and the difference to SHA1.
